Description: \
This repository contains notes and examples relating to financial engineering topics. The plan is to develop the scripts in Python for the moment (maybe other languages in the future). I will include interactive Python notebooks (.ipynb files) that have notes and examples. 

## Core contents
1. `options.ipynb` $\rightarrow$ CALL And PUT options, LONG and SHORT positions on each option type.
2. `stochastic_models` $\rightarrow$ Monte Carlo simulations to simulate stock prices
3. `black-scholes` $\rightarrow$ Black-Scholes model for options pricing
